Gosu-Android
============
A Gosu implementation for Adroid devices.

Instalation
-----------
Download the sources and add them to a [ruboto](http://github.com/ruboto/ruboto) proyect.
They should be placed where `gosu.rb` file will be accesible to your application, so you can add the
require without further trouble $ require 'gosu'

General Information
-------------------
* This is still an early effort, so there are a number of features that had not yet been added. 
* There are some known bugs that I hope to fix soon.
* In its current status there are some small changes to Gosu Window initialization, check examples.
* A new object with some basic physics has been added.
